# Ktor Chat

This project is an example for using [fritz2](https://www.fritz2.dev/) with in a ktor websocket-application.
It will demonstrate how-to interact with a backend application in fritz2 and how-to setup this kind of project.

This project is a Kotlin [multiplatform](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/multiplatform.html) project which contains everything.
In the `commonMain` section is the shared model and validation of the application.
The `jsMain` section contains the complete code of the client-application written with fritz2. 
The backend part is in the `jvmMain` section where all the code for the server is.

This project uses the following libraries:
* [fritz2](https://github.com/jwstegemann/fritz2) - mainly in the frontend, except validation and model in both sides
* [kotlinx.serialization](https://github.com/Kotlin/kotlinx.serialization) - used in frontend and backend for serializing the shared model
* [Ktor](https://ktor.io/) - running the server with
* [Ktor Websockets](https://ktor.io/docs/servers-features-websockets.html) - providing Websocket-based API
* [Exposed](https://github.com/JetBrains/Exposed) - making CRUD operations to the database
* [H2 Database](https://www.h2database.com/html/main.html) - running as in-memory-db which stores the data
